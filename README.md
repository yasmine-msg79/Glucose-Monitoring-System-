# Non-invasive Glucose Monitoring System

This project is a non-invasive glucose monitoring system that uses near-infrared (NIR) light to measure the glucose concentration in human blood.

## Motivation

Regular monitoring of glucose levels is essential for people with diabetes, but the current methods that involve finger pricking are invasive, costly and painful. Not to mention the risk of infection from the needles. This project aims to create a system that can measure glucose levels without any contact with the skin.


## Features

The system consists of the following components:

- A NIR LED that shines through a sample of blood
- Two phototransistors that detect the changes in light intensity
- An Arduino UNO microcontroller that processes the data and displays the results

The system has the following advantages:

- Accurate: The system can measure glucose levels with high precision and accuracy
- Fast: The system can display the results within seconds
- Easy to use: The system does not require any calibration or preparation
- Non-invasive: The system does not require any contact with the skin or needles


## Usage

To use the system, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a sample of blood in a transparent container (e.g. a glass tube)
2. Place the sample between the NIR LED and the phototransistors on the breadboard
3. Press the button on the Arduino board to start the measurement
4. Wait for a few seconds until the serial monitor display shows the glucose concentration in mg/dL
5. Remove the sample and repeat with another sample if needed

## Future work

The system is still in the prototype stage and has some limitations and challenges. Some of the future work includes:

- Improving the robustness and reliability of the system against noise and interference
- Making the system more portable and user-friendly by using a smaller and wireless device
- Testing the system with real human blood samples and validating its performance with clinical standards
- Exploring other methods and algorithms for measuring glucose levels using NIR light
